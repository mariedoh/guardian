If you don’t confirm your arrival in time, Guardian automatically:

Notifies your pre-defined emergency contacts.

Shares your last known location.

📍 Perimeter Lock

Define a personal safe zone radius around your location.

If your device moves beyond this boundary, Guardian:

Sends an SMS alert to your registered emergency contacts.

Includes your last known location in the alert.

🚨 Emergency Mode

Activate in high-risk situations.

While in Emergency Mode:

Shaking the phone discreetly triggers a 30-second hidden video recording.
